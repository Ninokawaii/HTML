          A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, 
        and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you 
        do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
        <br> A good example of a paragraph contains a topic sentence, details and a conclusion.
